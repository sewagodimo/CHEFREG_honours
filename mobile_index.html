    <h1 >ICTChefs: A mobile application for ICT</h1>
    <p>What follows is an overview of the project - or greater detail on the project, please download the <a href="documents/mtledn001_chefreg_report.pdf"> full paper. <a></p>
    <h2> Background</h2>
    <p>Infinity Culinary Training (ICT) is a non-profit organisation that
equips young disadvantaged men and women with basic cooking
skills to find employment. In addition to professional culinary
skills, the organisation strives to foster life skills to encourage
personal development and enable students to thrive in the catering
industry [7]. Students who have been accepted to the program go
through a 3-month intensive training program followed by a 1
month paid internship and a placement in the work field. After
each class begins their internship placements a new group of
students begins their training. Each class is made up of at least 20
students. ICT started in 2009 and has over 297 graduates to date.</p>
   <p> One of the things that set ICT apart is their commitment to the
personal development of students [7], even after they have
graduated from the school. It is important for the organisation to
remain in contact with their graduates to continue to support them
on their professional journeys. However, the increase in the
number of graduates has made this a more difficult task for the
administrative staff which is made up of only 3 people.</p>
<p>
The school uses a spreadsheet to keep record of all their student
information. The spreadsheet is shared by everyone in the
administrative team. Any changes to the student’s information
must be entered by the admin team manually. To put this into
perspective, every time any of the 297 graduates changes their
phone number someone in the admin team must find that
student’s record in the spreadsheet and update it. </p>
 <h2> Research Questions</h2>
 <h3>The following research question has been formulated for the project:</h3>
 <li>How can the artefacts generated through the design
process help with implementing a usable system for the
school?</li>
<li>What needs do former students identify in a platform
that aims to encourage them to remain in contact with
the school?</li>
<li>How can we empower the SAS of ICT to actively
contribute their knowledge and expertise to the design
process?</li>

<h2>Co-design</h2>
<p>
  Co design is a design process in which designers and nondesigners
work collectively in a design development process [17].
A major challenge in software development is the gap between
user requirements and the understanding of those requirements by
researchers and/or designers during the design phase of software
projects [14]. Literature shows that numerous projects have been
successful at employing user-centered design and co-design
methods to reduce this gap. Results from these projects point to
the benefits of user participation, which include a better fit
between the system and users’ needs, improved system quality,
improved user satisfaction, and improved mutual understanding
[17,14,2]. Successful co-design projects have collaborated with
children, elderly people, and employees from various sectors [17].
While there are projects that have developed applications for
chefs and chef students, it appears that none of these have made
attempts to include the chefs and students in the design process
[23]. Thus, our research project sets out to collaborate with chef
students and involve them in all significant stages of design to
reap the benefits of co-design. We believe our research will
contribute novel scientific knowledge about co-designing with
chefs and chef students.
</p>
<h2> Analysis and requirements</h2>
<p>
We identified all the important stakeholders of the school and
interviewed them during the initial phase of the project. This
included, observing the administrative team to learn about the
tools they were using at the time and discussing with them what
the pros and cons of those tools presented, interviewing their
alumni and current students about their school experiences and
how they communicate with the school. We took a special interest
in how their alumni kept in contact with the school as this was
crucial to the school maintaining an updated record.</p>
<h2>Prototyping</h2>
<p>
We developed prototypes as part of the design process to model
variations of the ICTchefs. Prototypes allow designers to
evaluate their designs while they are still in the formative stage.
Which makes it possible to demonstrate the behaviour of an
interface very early in development and test designs with actual
users. The prototyping phase of the project was made up of 3
iterations, the low-fidelity, a medium-fidelity, and high-fidelity
prototype. Each iteration of design produced prototype which will
be tested to evaluate whether they reflect user requirements.
Methods for evaluating these prototypes are outlined later in this
paper. The medium fidelity prototype artefact was designed using
Microsoft PowerPoint while software prototype was designed
using open source development tools .</p>

 <div class="header" id="paper">Evaluation Methods</div>
 <p>We used three methods in the user evaluations, a cognitive
walkthrough of the prototype, a usability questionnaire and a
heuristic test; Cognitive walkthroughs were conducted to examine
how users interacted with the interfaces and enable us to
determine whether users unfamiliar with the design can perform
tasks with ease. The method was selected because it would enable
us to put ourselves in the shoes of the user. The usability
questionnaire was useful because it gave us the opportunity to
enable participants to express their experiences and provide
recommendations about improvements. The heuristic
evaluation of the medium prototype was conducted to assess the
usability of the interface against a set of predetermined heuristics
or guidelines. All three methods were appropriate for this
project because they are cheap, easy and effective means of
evaluating usability with a small number of participants</p>
