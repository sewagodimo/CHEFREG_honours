    <h1 >ICTChefs: A mobile application for ICT</h1>
    <p>What follows is an overview of the project - for greater detail on the project, please download the <a href="documents/mtledn001_chefreg_report.pdf"> full paper. <a></p>
    <h2> Background</h2>
    <p>Infinity Culinary Training (ICT) is a non-profit organisation that
equips young disadvantaged men and women with basic cooking
skills to find employment. In addition to professional culinary
skills, the organisation strives to foster life skills to encourage
personal development and enable students to thrive in the catering
industry. Students who have been accepted to the program go
through a 3-month intensive training program followed by a 1
month paid internship and a placement in the work field. After
each class begins their internship placements a new group of
students begins their training. Each class is made up of at least 20
students. ICT started in 2009 and has over 297 graduates to date.</p>
   <p> One of the things that set ICT apart is their commitment to the
personal development of students, even after they have
graduated from the school. It is important for the organisation to
remain in contact with their graduates to continue to support them
on their professional journeys. However, the increase in the
number of graduates has made this a more difficult task for the
administrative staff which is made up of only 3 people.</p>
<p>
The school uses a spreadsheet to keep record of all their student
information. The spreadsheet is shared by everyone in the
administrative team. Any changes to the student’s information
must be entered by the admin team manually. To put this into
perspective, every time any of the 297 graduates changes their
phone number someone in the admin team must find that
student’s record in the spreadsheet and update it. </p>
 <h2> Research Questions</h2>
 <h3>The following research questions have been formulated for the project:</h3>
 <li>How can the artefacts generated through the design
process help with implementing a usable system for the
school?</li>
<li>What needs do former students identify in a platform
that aims to encourage them to remain in contact with
the school?</li>
<li>How can we empower the SAS of ICT to actively
contribute their knowledge and expertise to the design
process?</li>
</div>

<div class="header" >Methodology</div>
<h2>Co-design</h2>
<p>
  Co design is a design process in which designers and nondesigners
work collectively in a design development process.
A major challenge in software development is the gap between
user requirements and the understanding of those requirements by
researchers and/or designers during the design phase of software
projects. Literature shows that numerous projects have been
successful at employing user-centered design and co-design
methods to reduce this gap. Results from these projects point to
the benefits of user participation, which include a better fit
between the system and users’ needs, improved system quality,
improved user satisfaction, and improved mutual understanding. Successful co-design projects have collaborated with
children, elderly people, and employees from various sectors.
While there are projects that have developed applications for
chefs and chef students, it appears that none of these have made
attempts to include the chefs and students in the design process. Thus, our research project sets out to collaborate with chef
students and involve them in all significant stages of design to
reap the benefits of co-design. We believe our research will
contribute novel scientific knowledge about co-designing with
chefs and chef students.
</p>
<h2> Analysis and requirements</h2>
<p>
We identified all the important stakeholders of the school and
interviewed them during the initial phase of the project. This
included, observing the administrative team to learn about the
tools they were using at the time and discussing with them what
the pros and cons of those tools presented, interviewing their
alumni and current students about their school experiences and
how they communicate with the school. We took a special interest
in how their alumni kept in contact with the school as this was
crucial to the school maintaining an updated record.</p>
<h2>Prototyping</h2>
<p>
We developed prototypes as part of the design process to model
variations of the ICTchefs. Prototypes allow designers to
evaluate their designs while they are still in the formative stage.
Which makes it possible to demonstrate the behaviour of an
interface very early in development and test designs with actual
users. The prototyping phase of the project was made up of 3
iterations, the low-fidelity, a medium-fidelity, and high-fidelity
prototype. Each iteration of design produced prototype which will
be tested to evaluate whether they reflect user requirements.
Methods for evaluating these prototypes are outlined later in this
paper. The medium fidelity prototype artefact was designed using
Microsoft PowerPoint while software prototype was designed
using open source development tools.</p>

 <div style="display: block;">
 <div > <img src="images/iterate.png" style="width: 40%;float: right;padding-right: 3%;">
  <p style="width: 60%">We used three methods in the user evaluations, a cognitive
walkthrough of the prototype, a usability questionnaire and a
heuristic test; Cognitive walkthroughs were conducted to examine
how users interacted with the interfaces and enable us to
determine whether users unfamiliar with the design can perform
tasks with ease. The method was selected because it would enable
us to put ourselves in the shoes of the user. The usability
questionnaire was useful because it gave us the opportunity to
enable participants to express their experiences and provide
recommendations about improvements. The heuristic
evaluation of the medium prototype was conducted to assess the
usability of the interface against a set of predetermined heuristics
or guidelines. All three methods were appropriate for this
project because they are cheap, easy and effective means of
evaluating usability with a small number of participants</p>

      <p style="width: 80%">The software prototype of the mobile application was developed
based on the feedback from the second iteration. It was built on
android studio, it only works on android devices. Next, we
describe the design process of the mobile application software
prototype and the user evaluation.</br>
The second porotype addressed most of the issues with the first
prototype, it allowed the participants and researchers to clear
misunderstandings that they have about the application’s
functionality. The rich interface gave the participants a more
realistic view of the application’s navigation. The participants
agreed that even though the navigation drawer worked well in the
paper prototype it would not be helpful in the final prototype.
They recommended that we replace it with a top menu bar that
would use icons. This way the menu it always visible to the
students. It was also suggested that all the ‘help me’ options have
one colour as the varying colours might be a visual query to some
users. Most of the participants found the ‘other’ option helpful,
they also recommended that it include an option to allow the
students to inform the school when they would like to meet. This
will let them know how urgent the matter is to the student. </p>

    <h3>Heuristic Feedback</h3>
  <p style="padding-right: 15%;">
In our discussion with the administrative staff about the
application, they were pleased with of the layout and theme of the
application. The want the application to have on swipe
capabilities, as this will make it simpler for users. They also want
the ‘Donation’ option to be removed from the application. For the
application. They noted that the login screen buttons look more like text than
buttons so we should add a 3D feel to them. They did not like the
dark burgundy colour of the application on the registration form,
they suggested that we make the colour much brighter. They also
suggested that the colour of the dialog boxed should be white and
not the application’s theme colour

      <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough Feedback</h3>
        <p style="padding-right: 15%;">
The login and logout tasks where the simples to perform. For
every task in the walkthrough as large majority of the students
found it ‘very simple’ to perform. The task that had the highest
variation in responses was the ‘make a donation’ task, it was also
the only one that was marked ‘difficult’. No participant marked
any task as ‘very difficult’. Some of the students tried to register
through the login interface but realised later that they had to click
on the register button first.

    <h3>Usability Feedback</h3>
    <div style="padding-right: 2%;">
      <p style="padding-right: 20%;">
All the students that used the ICTchefs agreed that the
application simplified their communication with the school. A few
of the participants indicated that they are neutral about using the
application as oppose to going to the school directly, however,
most them agreed that they would use the application to
communicate with the school. During the first phase of the project
the administrative team told us that the students often struggle to
inform them about any problems that they have. In the usability
questionnaire, all the students disagreed to being
uncomfortable performing the tasks. None of the participants were
concerned about their data or airtime being consumed while using
the application.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
 <p style="padding-right: 15%;"> We engaged in a co-design project with ICT with the purpose of
designing ICTchef, a mobile application prototype to allow their
current students and alumni that would allow them to effectively
communicate with the school. We included the admin, teachers,
alumni and students in the co-design venture from the beginning,
on the premise that by building a relationship with them we could
gain a better understanding of their requirements and they would
come to a point of being more empowered to contribute
productively to the design process. The project was divided into
two phases, the analysis and requirement phase. Our results
confirm that building a relationship with the school helped us gain
a better understanding of their requirements. Empowering the
participates to take part in the design process increases the value
of the user evaluations. We can also confirm that that iteratively
development with extensive user testing ensures that the final
prototype is user friendly and meets the needs of the school</p>
