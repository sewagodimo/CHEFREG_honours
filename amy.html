    <h1 >ICTChefs: An admin web application for ICT</h1>
    <p>What follows is an overview of the project - for greater detail on the project, please download the <a href="documents/FinalPaper_amy.pdf"> full paper. <a></p>
    <h2> Background</h2>
<p>Infinity Culinary Training (ICT) is a non-profit organisation that
    equips young disadvantaged men and women with basic cooking
    skills to find employment. In addition to professional culinary
    skills, the organisation strives to foster life skills to encourage
    personal development and enable students to thrive in the catering
    industry. Students who have been accepted to the program go
    through a 3-month intensive training program followed by a 1
    month paid internship and a placement in the work field. After
    each class begins their internship placements a new group of
    students begins their training. Each class is made up of at least 20
    students. ICT started in 2009 and has over 297 graduates to date.</p>

<p> One of the things that set ICT apart is their commitment to the
    personal development of students, even after they have
    graduated from the school. It is important for the organisation to
    remain in contact with their graduates to continue to support them
    on their professional journeys. However, the increase in the
    number of graduates has made this a more difficult task for the
    administrative staff which is made up of only 3 people.</p>

<p>
    The school uses a spreadsheet to keep record of all their student
    information. The spreadsheet is shared by everyone in the
    administrative team. Any changes to the student’s information
    must be entered by the admin team manually. To put this into
    perspective, every time any of the over 300 graduates changes their
    phone number someone in the admin team must find that
    student’s record in the spreadsheet and update it. </p>

 <h2> Research Questions</h2>
 <h3>The following research question has been formulated for the project:</h3>
 <li>How would admin staff want to use the system to more effectively manage their daily operations?</li>
<li>How would the admin staff feel about the design process and the use of low, medium and high fidelity prototypes in designing a usable system for the school?</li>
<li>What features would the admin staff identify to be most important in the design of an admin system?</li>

<div class="header" >Methodology</div>
<h2>Co-design</h2>
<p>
    Co-design is a methodology that focuses on the collaboration of researchers/designers and the end-users in all phases
    of the design and implementation of a project. It can be viewed as a way to help organise joint creativity between
    the end-users and the researchers/designers. It allows for an early focus on the end-user which is beneficial for
    understanding the end-users needs and wants early in the project. In co-design end-users and researchers/designers
    will jointly create sketches, prototypes, mock-ups and other generative tools that aid communication to design a solution
    for the end-user’s problem. The knowledge of the end-users and researchers/designers is brought together to
    generate knowledge about a favourable future solution. In other words, co-design is a collaboration of all stakeholders
    to create a solution/product that solves a problem for the end-users.
    With the above in mind, a co-design methodology was adopted for the project. This allowed the stakeholders at ICT to collaboratively
    co-create an admin system that would benefit them. This methodology was followed throughout the project with stakeholders at
    ICT helping to design prototypes in all three iterations.
</p>
<h2> Analysis and requirements</h2>
<p>
    ICT currently makes use of an excel spreadsheet to keep track of all students and graduates. This spreadsheet keeps track
    of the name, contact details and employment details of all students and graduates. As the number of graduates increases it
    becomes increasingly difficult for ICT to manage and maintain this spreadsheet. The stakeholders at ICT helped to collaboratively
    co-create an admin system that would replace their spreadsheet database. The creation of the admin web application took place in three iterations.
    In the first iteration, the stakeholders collaborated on thedesign of a paper prototype of the admin web application to determine the key features
    required of the system. The second iteration involved the co-creation of an interactive prototype which aided the refinement of the key
    features and helped in determining which features were most important. Finally, the third iteration involved the creation of a software prototype
    based upon the design and feedback acquired from the previous iterations. </p>

<h2>Prototyping</h2>
<p>
    The first iteration of this project involved the creation of a paper prototype which modelled the idea of an admin system
    to replace the excel spreadsheets currently used. The feedback from the paper prototype was used for the design phase of the
    second iteration. The second iteration involved the creation of an interactive prototype in powerpoint, this prototype
    included any additions or changes made in the previous iteration. The feedback from the interactive prototype was then
    used in the design phase of the third iteration. The third iteration involved the creation of a software prototype which
    included the additions and changes from the second iteration. It was created using a mysql database, Django back-end and
    a HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end.</p>

 <div class="header" id="eval">Evaluation Methods</div>
 <p>Two methods were used to evaluate the project, these methods were usability testing and heuristic evaluation.
     The usability tests will evaluate how the users interact with the interface and the ease-of-use of the interface.
     The heuristic evaluations were used to assess the design of the interface and support the identification of flaws in
     the design. These methods were necessary to the project and ensured that each prototype was thoroughly tested and
     met the needs of the stakeholders.</p>

  <div class="header" id="results">Results</div>
  <p>
      The results showed that the paper prototype of the first iteration led to a better design of the system.
      They also showed that the interactive prototype of the second iteration further improved on the design and provided
      better usability. Finally, they showed that the software prototype of the third iteration had further improved upon
      the system design and produced an intuitive and usable system for ICT. Each iteration helped to ensure that the
      solution was aligned with the needs of ICT and provided the functionality they deemed important. Therefore,
      the iterative process was ultimately a success and greatly aided the software design process.
